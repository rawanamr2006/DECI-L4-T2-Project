Backdoor Details:
----------------

rouge username: darklord

malicious process: remotesec (PID: 1080)

remote port it is listening on: 56565



Justification:
--------------

After the attacker managed to break into the system and escalate their privilege to root, they:

1. created a new user with the rogue username "darklord"
2. launched a process with the name "remotesec" and PID of "1080" that allows them to log in through a non-standard port number "56565"


My Mitigation Steps:
--------------------

After identifying the backdoor details through system commands and the HIDS logs, I :

1. deleted the user "darklord" using the command : sudo userdel -r darklord
2. killed the malicious process using the command : sudo kill -9 1080
