Additional Security Recommendations for Securing Remote Access:
---------------------------------------------------------------

The following are some configuration changes recommended , changes are made to the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file:

1. change the "Port" to be any other random number than the default port "22" to deflect automated bots looking for open port 22 to brute force credentials
 
2. use the "MaxAuthTries" of some value to prevent brute force attacks and limit authentication tries

3. use authentication keys instead of passwords , you are recommended to use MFA also

4. create a list of allowed users using the "AllowUsers" configuration parameter
